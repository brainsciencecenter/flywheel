Google billing Service Descriptions are currently:

BigQuery
Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)
Cloud Storage
Compute Engine
Google Click to Deploy Deep Learning VM
Kubernetes Engine
Security Command Center
Source Repository
Stackdriver Logging
Stackdriver Monitoring

We probably only care about

Cloud Storage
Compute Engine
Kubernetes (maybe under compute?)
Misc (everything else)

Re for each:
Cloud Storage = 'Cloud Storage'
Kubernetes&Compute = '(Compute Engine)|Kubernetes'
Misc = -v '(Cloud Storage)|(Compute Engine)|Kubernetes'

Main issue with gcp allocation is mapping google projects to billing codes
